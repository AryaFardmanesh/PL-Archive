# About This Repository

This repository is a collection of code and experiments centered on programming language design, as well as compiler and interpreter implementation. Over the years, I have built various projects through trial and errorâ€”each representing a different approach to language architecture. This repository serves as a memento of my learning journey.

**Please Note:**  
- The code here is experimental and may contain bugs, architectural quirks, and security vulnerabilities.  
- There is no need to file issues for these known imperfections.  
- Some projects may be incomplete; however, they still offer valuable insights into the basic concepts of compiler and interpreter design.

I am proud of the progress I have made, even though I recognize that there is still a long way to go. Thank you for exploring my work, and I hope it helps you on your own learning path.
